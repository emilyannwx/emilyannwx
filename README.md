## About Me

I recently graduated from CUNY Hunter College with a B.A. in Computer Science and a minor in Psychology. Lately, Iâ€™ve been focusing on building my skills in cybersecurity and IT while continuing to explore my interests in AI, machine learning, and data analytics. Iâ€™m passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems and create more equitable opportunities in tech. During my time at Hunter, I served on the leadership team of the Women in Computer Science (WiCS) club, where I helped foster a supportive and inclusive community for women in technology.

## ðŸ’» Fall AI Studio Project
Recently, I worked in a team to develop [an electricty price forecasting](https://github.com/pginjupalli/Verizon-BTTAI-ElectricityPriceForecasting) to forecast energy prices by state using historical data. Check out the full repository to explore the project and the code!
