# About Me

I'm a senior at CUNY Hunter College, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Psychology. I am passionate about data analysis, machine learning, and creating solutions that make a meaningful impact. I am deeply committed to promoting equity in tech, especially for underrepresented groups, and aspire to help make the tech industry more accessible for all.

I am currently focused on learning new tools and technologies, particularly in the areas of AI, machine learning, and data analytics. As a member of the leadership team in the Women in Computer Science (WiCS) club at Hunter College, I am dedicated to building a community that supports and empowers women in tech.
